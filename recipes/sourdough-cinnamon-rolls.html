      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <h4>How to Make the Sourdough Dough:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Combine the Ingredients:</strong> In the bowl of a stand
          mixer, combine active sourdough starter and milk, and whisk until
          smooth. Add the melted and cooled butter, vanilla, eggs, sugar, and
          salt, then whisk until fully combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add Flour and Knead:</strong> Using the dough hook attachment,
          gradually add the flour while mixing on low to medium speed. Once all
          the flour is incorporated, knead on speed 2 with the dough hook for 8
          to 10 minutes, or until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. The
          dough should feel very soft and moist but not stick to clean, dry
          fingertips (you can also knead by hand for 6 to 8 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rest and Refrigerate the Dough:</strong> Transfer the dough to
          a clean bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rest at room
          temperature for 2 hours. Then refrigerate the covered dough overnight
          (8 to 12 hours).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Filling and Rolling the Cinnamon Rolls:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Roll out the Dough:</strong> Remove dough from the
          refrigerator 1-2 hours before rolling it out. Lightly flour your work
          surface. Turn the dough onto the floured surface and roll it into a
          17×10-inch rectangle, squaring off the short sides. Butter the bottom
          and sides of a 9×13 metal baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spread butter and Cinnamon Sugar:</strong> Dot the surface of
          the dough with 6 tablespoons of softened butter, then spread it evenly
          using a spatula or offset spatula. In a small mixing bowl, combine the
          brown sugar and cinnamon, then sprinkle the mixture generously over
          the dough. Don’t hesitate to use all of it!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cut and Roll:</strong> Cut the dough into 12 strips using a
          pizza cutter. Roll each strip tightly, one at a time, and pinch the
          edges to seal them to prevent the rolls from unraveling while rising.
          Place the rolls in the buttered baking dish, evenly spaced. (You can
          cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight at this point or up
          to 12 hours if needed).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Second Proofing:</strong> Cover with a damp kitchen towel and
          let them proof in a warm room for 2 to 3 hours, or until puffed and
          visibly larger. If your kitchen is cooler, place the dish in the oven
          with the light on (around 80-90°F) to speed up proofing. Be sure to
          remove the dish before preheating the oven for baking!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat oven to 400˚F when the cinnamon rolls
          are nearly done proofing. Bake on the center rack for 18 to 20 minutes
          or until lightly golden at the edges. The center of the rolls should
          reach 190-200°F on an instant-read thermometer. Avoid overbaking, as
          this will make the rolls dry.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>How to Make the Cinnamon Roll Frosting:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the frosting</strong> while the rolls are baking. In a
          large mixing bowl, beat the butter and cream cheese together until
          smooth. Add the vanilla, powdered sugar, and a pinch of salt. Start
          mixing on low speed until the powdered sugar is incorporated, then
          increase to high speed and beat for 2 to 3 minutes, scraping down the
          bowl as needed until the icing is light, fluffy, and whipped.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spread on Frosting</strong> Once the cinnamon rolls are out of
          the oven, let them cool for 5 minutes. Spread the frosting generously
          over the very warm rolls, allowing it to melt slightly. Serve
          immediately and enjoy!
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>
        While glass or ceramic pans are also an option, they don’t conduct heat
        as quickly, which can result in longer bake times and over-baked rolls.
        Metal pans strike the perfect balance for soft, fluffy cinnamon rolls
        with just the right amount of browning.
