      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        These homemade Pierogi filled with cheesy potatoes, tossed with crisp
        bacon and melted butter, and served with sour cream is the ultimate
        comfort food. They can be served as the main dish or as an irresistible
        side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pierogi are as classic to Eastern European cuisine as Stuffed Cabbage
        Rolls, Piroshki, and Schnitzel. They will never go out of style. Watch
        the video tutorial and you’ll be enjoying pierogi in no time.

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <h4>How to Make Potato Cheese Filling:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place potatoes in a pot, add enough water to cover potatoes then bring
          to a boil over medium/high and continue cooking 25 minutes or until
          easily pierced with a fork. Drain and cool 5 minutes then mash
          potatoes until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mash in 1/2 tsp salt, 2 Tbsp melted butter and 2 oz cream cheese. Mash
          in 3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese. Partially cover and set aside
          while rolling out the dough.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>To Make Pierogi Dough:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In the bowl of a stand mixer (or large mixing bowl if mixing by hand),
          whisk together 1 cup warm water, 1/4 cup milk, 2 Tbsp sour cream, 1
          egg, 3 Tbsp oil, and 1 1/2 tsp salt until blended.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the dough hook attachment (or wooden spoon if done by hand), add
          2 cups flour and mix on speed 2 until incorporated. Add remaining
          flour 1/2 cup at a time, letting it incorporate before adding more.
          Add the last bit of flour, 1 Tbsp at a time, just until the dough no
          longer sticks to the sides of the bowl, or to your hands. Knead on
          speed 2 or by hand for 2-3 minutes until the dough is smooth and
          elastic. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>How to Mold Pierogi:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Divide dough into 2 pieces. Cover the second piece and thinly roll the
          first piece out onto a floured surface to just under 1/8” thickness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a 3” diameter round cookie cutter to cut circles from the dough,
          keeping them as close as possible (collect scraps and keep covered to
          re-use). Add 1/2 Tbsp of potatoes over each round (a mini scoop makes
          portioning easy).
        </li>
        <li>
          To form pierogi, pull the 2 edges together and pinch tightly to seal.
          To ensure a tight seal, crimp the edges a second time with a pinch and
          twist motion. Cook or freeze pierogi for a future dinner (see freezing
          instructions in post).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>How to Make Bacon Topping:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Make the topping before boiling pierogi so it’s ready to drizzle over
          pierogi to prevent sticking. In a medium skillet, saute bacon. Once
          crisp, melt in 2 Tbsp butter and remove from heat.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>How to Cook Pierogi:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil and add 1 Tbsp salt. Add fresh
          or frozen pierogi in batches. Cook for about 2 minutes or until the
          water has returned to a boil and the pierogi float to the top. Remove
          to a bowl with a strainer or slotted spoon drizzling buttery bacon
          between layers.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>
        This recipe makes 55-60 pierogi, based on how thinly you roll. Recipe
        updated 4/4/24 – we added oil to the dough and reduced the kneading time
        for a softer, more tender dough.
