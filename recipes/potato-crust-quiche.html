      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Our Potato Crusted Quiche recipe swaps the traditional quiche dough
        crust with a potato crust, creating a delicious, gluten-free
        alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        The potato crust not only makes it easier to prepare than a classic pie
        crust, but it also cuts the cooking time in half (no pre-baking of the
        crust required)! Plus, leftovers reheat beautifully.

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 400°F. Add the potatoes and enough water to cover
          them by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, then add 1 ½ Tbsp salt. Reduce heat
          to medium and cook at a medium boil until the potatoes are
          fork-tender, about 20-30 minutes, depending on the size of the
          potatoes. Drain well and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the potatoes cook, set a 10-inch cast iron pan (or a
          heavy-bottomed, oven-safe pan) over medium heat and add the chopped
          bacon. Cook until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crisp. Remove
          the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the diced onions to
          the bacon fat and sauté, stirring often, until the onions are golden.
          Turn off the heat and transfer the onions to the plate with the bacon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the potatoes to the cast iron skillet over the bacon grease in a
          single layer. Sprinkle with ¼ tsp salt. The salt is needed here to
          make the crust tasty, so don’t skip it!
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the bottom of a glass or measuring cup to press the potatoes
          firmly into the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of the pan,
          closing any gaps to form a complete crust.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, whisk the eggs. Then, add the half and half, ½ tsp
          fine sea salt, pepper, paprika, and nutmeg. Whisk vigorously for a
          minute to incorporate some air into the mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the cheese, onion, and most of the chopped bacon (set some
          aside for garnish). Pour the filling into the potato crust. Bake at
          400°F for about 25-30 minutes, or until the filling is set (it
          shouldn’t jiggle when you jolt the pan) and reaches an internal
          temperature of 160°F. Let cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Garnish
          with the remaining bacon and parsley or chives, if desired.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Prepare Potato Crust Quiche in a 10-inch cast iron skillet or use a

        not use a springform pan because it leaks.
